# The Illustrator files for the schoolplans

> the composed.ai file is the important one 
> the others are just for testing

## How they were made
- we got the original schoolplans as `.dwg` and `.dwf` files
- these were converted using a converted (i used  [this one](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/autocad-forum/how-to-convert-a-drawing-dwg-file-to-svg/td-p/3506036)) but any will do
- somehow some files errored (after using multiple different converters) so i had to draw the rest of the first floor myself
- after all 3 were finished i made sure they are the same size by adding a viewport in the `composed.ai` file

## What if you need to change something
- if you don't have to change the structure (just styling) do so in the `svg-viewer` components stylesheet
- if you have to change some layout you need to do so in the illustrator file
    - make sure to not delete any of the invisible `<rect>`s for click listening
    - make sure to not change the viewport
    - after making changes export to a single svg file and copy the grouped elements
    - if you were carefull you don't need to rewrite the angular bindings for the invisble room boxes (but you need to delete them from the bottom of the new svg)
