# Open source weather icon

- There's actually not much of the icons used. The only ones occuring are in the `WeatherOverviewComponent` [here](https://github.com/KaindlJulian/IoT-Webclient/blob/34cc49f0cd9ea36498c89e35d90805b9598d936d/src/app/modules/dashboard/pages/weather-overview/weather-overview.component.html#L25) and in the weather module

- This is a lot of css. Its nice to work with, but shipps probably some uneccesary css

- Usage, Examples, Icons Lists and more Details can be found on the projects github repository https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons and their website https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/
