= Docker Compose

== Default Docker Compose

=== Location
`docker-compose.yml`

=== Purpose

With this docker compose you can build the whole project and start it.

== Deploy Docker Compose

=== Location

- `docker-compose.deploy.yml`

=== Purpose

The deploy docker compose is a special docker compose which doesn't include the build paths to the dockerfiles for each component. We only use it for GitHub action deployment

With this docker-compose the application will start without the whole project. With the normal docker-compose this is not the case because of the build paths.

== Database Docker Compose

=== Location

- `database/docker-compose.yml`

=== Purpose

This docke-compose file is for backend development. It will start our basic link:https://www.timescale.com/[TimescaleDB].
