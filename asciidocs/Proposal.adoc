== Project Name
Leo-IOT

== Employer

* HTL Leonding

== Background
Within our education at the HTBLA Leonding
the students have to work on projects.
One of them is an IoT-Project about collecting physical values measured in a classroom.

== Project Result
The result of this project is a compact container which include various sensors.
Those sensors/actors in the room detect the physical values in the classroom (air moisture, temperature, sound intensity, etc.).
The data is collected and saved in a database.
The information is shown on a display/digital screen in a clear and attractive way.

== Project Target
The aim of the project is to be able to check the current
status of a classroom in terms of volume, temperatur, etc.
Depending on the status of the current class the necessary
actions can be taken to improve the climate.

== Project Description

* reworking the Cockpit
* sensor installation in early bird classes
