ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: images]

== Purpose

The aim of the Simulator is to send testdata to a MQTT-Broker, wich can be used to Test the sofware without a physical sensor.

In the future the Simulator will persist Data in a Database. Also all rooms without a sensorbox should recieve mock values from the value simulator automatically.  

=== How to setup the Simulator?

Start Quarkus with 

[source,console]
----
./mvnw clean compile quarkus:dev
----

Connect with the MQTT-Server. For example with link:http://mqtt-explorer.com/[MQTT-Explorer]. Ask the leader for the Password.

Use a Tool like link:https://www.postman.com/downloads/[Postman] to Add or Delete Rooms. Make sure that you choose POST instead of GET on the left.

then you can see the new Room displayed on the MQTT-Server. Every Room without a sensor has simulated values. The Temperature for example, changes his value just a little bit like the real temperature value would.

If you want to delete the room you created before you can use postman like in this picture again.
